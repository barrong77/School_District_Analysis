# School_District_Analysis
Overview of the district analysis:

At the High School level, academic dishonesty was analayzed and used to determine if it occurred for ninth graders.  Using Python Data - Py City Schools Starter Codeand Pandas, I was able to analyze grades, averages and budgets. Included is a screenshot of the schools summary showing all the budget information, % overall passing and spending ranges. Also, included is a screenshot of the top and bottom performing schools to see the calculations where performed. Please see screenshots at School District Analysis RTF in the repository.
 
 

Results:
- The overall passing percentage went from 65% to 64.9%.
- The Percentage of Math and Reading scores decreased/increased.  For example, Math decreased from 75% to 74.8%.
- The average math percentage decreased at the focus school (Thomas High School) from 83.42% to 83.35%.
- The Average Reading at Thomas High School increased from 83.34% to 83.89%.
Summary:
We were asked to replace data from the ninth graders math and reading scores at Thomas High School to see if there where any changes on other high schools.  When I replaced the ninth grade scores the average math score went from 79% to 78.9%.  Also, for math, the percentage decreased from 75% to 74.8%.  The overall passing went from 65% to 64.9%.
